#### The intuition of back-propagation
##### Be a back-prop guru

For the back propagation function back propagation to work, `hello world` is beyond
    def hello():
        print("Hello World")
        
This is the function to use in back propagation 

$$ f(w, x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w_{0}x_{0}+w_{1}x_{1}+w_{2}x_{2})}} $$
