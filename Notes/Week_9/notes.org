* Anomaly Detection
** Density Estimation
   Given a non-anomalous dataset, {x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, ..., x^{(m)}}, is x_{test} anomalous ?
   We create a model p(x), 
   if p(x_{test}) <= \epsilon, Flag as an anomaly
   if p(x_{test}) > \epsilon, Flag as ok
   Some common applications include Fraud Detection, with the Dataset being the usage patterns
   of the user, *manufacturing*, *monitoring computers in a data center*
** Gaussian Distribution
   Also called the /Normal Distribution/, the Gaussian distribution is the 
   familiar bell-shaped curve that can be described by \(\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)\).

   Let \(x \in \mathbb{R}\). If the probability distribution of \(x\) is 
   Gaussian, with a mean of \mu and variance of \sigma^2, then:
   \begin{equation}
   x \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
   \end{equation}
   The probability distribution can be calculated as
   \begin{equation}
   p(x;\mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
   \end{equation}
   The mean of the distribution, \mu decides where the bell-curve is centered. The
   variance, \sigma^2 denotes the width or the sharpness of the distribution. A
   distribution with a wider width will have larger \sigma^2. Intuitively, the 
   variance is a measure of how far away from the mean the distribution is
   clustered.

   Given a distribution \(x\), 
   \begin{equation}
   \mu = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i = 1}^{m}x^{(i)}
   \end{equation}
   and
   \begin{equation}
   \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(x^{(i)} - \mu)^{2}
   \end{equation}
